Apply the CI Fuzz Maven extension to your Maven project by adding the following configuration block to your `.mvn/extensions.xml` file:

    <extensions>
      <extension>
        <groupId>com.code-intelligence</groupId>
        <artifactId>cifuzz-maven-extension</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-rc2</version>
      </extension>
    </extensions>

In a **multi-project**, you have to mark the project that contains the fuzz tests by setting the `cifuzz.fuzztests` property in the `<project-folder>/pom.xml`:

    <properties>
      <cifuzz.fuzztests>true</cifuzz.fuzztests>
    </properties>

By default, the `cifuzz.yaml` should be located in the root of your Maven project.
